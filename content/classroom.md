Prior to this author study unit, students have been working on finding theme within different types of literature. They have practiced this skill across multiple units including the last unit which focused on Traditional Literature.

#### 3-K Digital Lesson on Octopi

This lesson is one of ten created for a Number Study Unit. The main focus in this lesson is the number 8. A lesson about octopi was created to reinforce the concept of symmetry, the theme for that weeks lessons, as well cover a topic that the children were interested in. In order to be compatible for distance learning Power Point was chosen as the medium to display pictures that corresponded with the information being provided by the educator. Prior to this lesson, the children were introduced to the concept of symmetry through a hands on activity of drawing a line through the center of basic geometric shapes, folding the images along this line and determining if they were symmetrical or asymmetrical. In the following lesson, the students will continue learning about symmetry as we explore insects and make symmetrical rubbings.
